[01:08.68] Baby if you want to
[01:11.94] I'll take you to Shangri-La
[01:14.78] And walk up to the shore
[01:19.64] You can dance if you want to
[01:23.34] Be a rising star
[01:26.29] In a distant glow
[01:34.79] 
[01:54.19] Baby if you want to
[01:57.45] I'll take you to Shangri-La
[02:00.24] It's the other end of the line
[02:05.11] Let me know when you need it
[02:08.73] It's a different space
[02:11.56] In a different time
