It's the end of a perfect day
For surfer boys and girls
The sun's dropping down in the bay
And falling off the world
There's a diamond in the sky
Our evening star
In our shangri-la
Get that fire burning strong
Right here and right now
It's here and then it's gone
There's no secret, anyhow
We may never love again
To the music of guitars
In our shangri-la
Tonight your beauty burns
Into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns
Above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our shangri-la
This is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our shangri-la
