Show me the way to paradise
Where the people are friendly and very very nice
Be what you want and don't have to think twice
How far is Shangri-la from here? x2

By no fool
Educated in a grammar school
Boy meets boy, die the girl
Its a mixed up, muddled up violent world

How far is Shangri-la from here? x2
And is it this way?

Oh won't you show me the way to paradise
Where everyone's friendly and very very nice
Stab you in the back, don't think twice

How far is Shangri-la from here? x2
And is it that way?

How far is Shangri-la from here?
(From here)x4

Does this go
