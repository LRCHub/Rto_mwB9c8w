We face a lost horizon
The end of all we know
The dogma all pervasive flow

The haste and all the restraint
Riding for a fall
The shallowness has kept us small

We're all in dire need
Of help to come
Back to affinity
To finally come undone

The powers of perception
Have often gone astray
A down-right shame, the price to pay

A storm so punishing here
Will bring the about-turn
To go the distance and return

We came from miles around
With hopes that never died
Closely guarded secrets
In mystery they're attired

The road to Shangri-La
The last realm of the soul is a mystery
The spell of Shangri-la
An arcadian dream can be our treasury

The road to Shangri-la
The last realm of the soul is a mystery
The spell of Shangri-la
An arcadian dream can be our treasury

(The road to Shangri-la)
The road to Shangri-la
(The land behind the times is a mystery)
Time is a mystery here
(The peace of Shangri-la)
Shangri-la
(Is a mental gem of men without boundaries)
Shangri-la, woo
